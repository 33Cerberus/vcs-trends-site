  <h1>Key Milestones in Version Control History</h1>
  <p>
    The history of version control spans more than five decades, evolving from simple file tracking tools
    to globally distributed systems enabling massive collaboration.
  </p>

  <h2>Timeline of Major Systems</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>1972 – SCCS:</strong> One of the first systems, created at Bell Labs for IBM mainframes.</li>
    <li><strong>1982 – RCS:</strong> Introduced automated change tracking for individual files using delta storage.</li>
    <li><strong>1986 – CVS:</strong> Built on RCS, enabling multiple developers to collaborate via a client–server model.</li>
    <li><strong>2000 – Subversion (SVN):</strong> Improved CVS by adding atomic commits and better branching.</li>
    <li><strong>2005 – Git & Mercurial:</strong> Introduced distributed models — every developer had a full copy of the repo.</li>
    <li><strong>2008 – GitHub:</strong> Revolutionized collaboration with pull requests, issue tracking, and social coding.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Distributed Systems Change the Game</h2>
  <p>
    Unlike centralized systems, distributed VCS such as Git and Mercurial allow developers to work offline,
    create countless branches, and merge them efficiently.
    This flexibility made parallel development and open-source collaboration much easier.
