  <h1>Modern Trends in Version Control Systems</h1>
  <p>
    In the 2010s and 2020s, version control evolved into an integrated ecosystem that drives modern DevOps,
    cloud collaboration, and even AI-assisted workflows.
  </p>

  <h2>Current Industry Practices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>GitOps:</strong> Uses Git as the single source of truth for both code and infrastructure, automating deployments.</li>
    <li><strong>CI/CD Pipelines:</strong> Every commit triggers builds, tests, and deployments â€” ensuring faster, safer releases.</li>
    <li><strong>Cloud Hosting Platforms:</strong> GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket offer collaboration, code review, and automation tools.</li>
    <li><strong>AI in Code Management:</strong> Tools like GitHub Copilot assist in code writing, review, and bug detection.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The Future of Version Control</h2>
  <p>
    With over 100 million developers on GitHub, version control now powers global-scale collaboration.
    The next wave includes deeper AI integration, smarter conflict resolution, and more automation
    across development pipelines.
