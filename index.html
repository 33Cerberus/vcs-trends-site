  <h1>Version Control Systems (VCS) - Overview</h1>
  <p>
    Version Control Systems are essential tools that track changes in files over time,
    enable collaboration between developers, and maintain a full project history.
    They allow teams to work simultaneously and safely experiment through branches.
  </p>

  <h2>Main Types of Version Control</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Centralized Version Control (CVCS):</strong> A single server stores all project files. Examples: RCS, CVS, Subversion.</li>
    <li><strong>Distributed Version Control (DVCS):</strong> Every user has a complete copy of the repository. Examples: Git, Mercurial.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
  <p>
    VCS tools form the backbone of modern software engineering. From tracking bugs to deploying applications automatically,
    they make teamwork and automation possible at every stage of development.
